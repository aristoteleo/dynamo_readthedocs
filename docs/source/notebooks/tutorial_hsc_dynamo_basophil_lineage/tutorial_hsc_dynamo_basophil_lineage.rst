Minimal network for basophil lineage commitment
===============================================

Early studies reported that basophils are derived from GMPs (Iwasaki et
al., 2006; Truong and Ben-David, 2000). Our HSC dataset, however,
suggests that they mostly originated from MEP-like cells (with a minor
route from GMP-like cells), in line with recent scRNA-seq studies
(Drissen et al., 2016; Pellin et al., 2019). To reconcile the
discrepancy of two alternative trajectories of the Bas lineage, we
leverage RNA differential geometry analyses empowered by dynamo to
derive a minimal network model that explains Bas lineage’s dual origins.

Let us first import relevant packages and load the preprocessed HSC scNT-seq
dataset that reported in the dynamo Cell paper.

.. code:: ipython3

    %%capture
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    import sys
    import os
    
    import dynamo as dyn
    import seaborn as sns
    
    dyn.dynamo_logger.main_silence()


.. code:: ipython3

    adata_labeling = dyn.sample_data.hematopoiesis()

Regulatory network governing the Bas lineage’s dual origins
-----------------------------------------------------------
In order to reveal the minimal network of Bas lineage's dual origin, we
start with identifying putative drivers of Meg/Ery versu Bas lineage bifurcation.
We perform switch gene-pair analyses to identify gene pairs with antagonistic
interactions for genes responsible for the Ery and Bas lineage bifurcations.
This is done by selecting cells near the regions of the bifurcation point, followed by
ranking switch gene pairs. Something like the following:

.. code:: ipython3

    # select cells near the bifurcation to get bif_adata
    dyn.vf.rank_jacobian_genes(bif_adata, groups='cell_type', mode='switch')

Notably, the GATA2-PLEK pair ranked first
(see `ranking table <https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0092867421015774-mmc1.csv>`_).
Similar to PLEK's exclusivity in Meg,
the expression of GATA2 is specifically high in basophils, as shown below:

.. code:: ipython3

    dyn.pl.scatters(adata_labeling, color=["GATA2", "cell_type"])

Switch pair ranking analyses also prioritized the involvement of CEBPA and
RUNX1, previously reported in (Guo et al., 2017), as well as GATA1, the
master regulator of the GMP lineage. Next, we will perform Jacobian analyses
to reveal interactions between these genes.

.. code:: ipython3

    selected_genes = ["GATA2", "CEBPA", "RUNX1"]
    
    dyn.vf.jacobian(adata_labeling, regulators=selected_genes, effectors=selected_genes)
    dyn.pl.jacobian(
        adata_labeling,
        regulators="CEBPA",
        effectors=["RUNX1", "GATA2"],
        basis="umap"
    )

.. parsed-literal::

    Transforming subset Jacobian: 100%|██████████| 1947/1947 [00:00<00:00, 113006.61it/s]
    /Users/random/dynamo-release/dynamo/plot/vector_calculus.py:658: UserWarning: This figure includes Axes that are not compatible with tight_layout, so results might be incorrect.
      plt.tight_layout()



.. image:: output_8_1.png
   :width: 981px
   


From the above Jacobian analyses, it is clear that CEBPA represses both RUNX1 and GATA2。

Next we will also investigate the interactions between RUNX1 and GATA2:

.. code:: ipython3

    dyn.pl.jacobian(
        adata_labeling,
        effectors=["RUNX1", "GATA2"],
        basis="umap"
    )



.. parsed-literal::

    /Users/random/dynamo-release/dynamo/plot/vector_calculus.py:658: UserWarning: This figure includes Axes that are not compatible with tight_layout, so results might be incorrect.
      plt.tight_layout()



.. image:: output_9_1.png
   :width: 975px
   

It turns out that RUNX1 and GATA2 form a community that has both mutual activation and self-activation.

Subsequent Jacobian analyses also confirm the known repression from GATA1 to GATA2,
activation from GATA2 back to GATA1, as reported and modeld in `Jan Krumsiek, 2011 <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022649>`_.

.. code:: ipython3

    dyn.vf.jacobian(
        adata_labeling,
        effectors=["GATA1", "GATA2"],
    )
    
    dyn.pl.jacobian(
        adata_labeling,
        effectors=["GATA1", "GATA2"],
        basis="umap"
    )

A minimal network governing GMP vs. Bas origin of Bas lineage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Collectively, above analyses reveal a network comprises the repression
  from key regulators of both GMP lineage and MEP lineage (CEBPA and
  GATA1 respectively) to the basophil master regulators GATA2 and RUNX1,
  suggesting that Bas lineage can arise via two potential trajectories,
  from either GMP or MEP cells, consistent with (Drissen et al., 2019).
